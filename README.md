## Problem
With the advent of zero-commission trade platforms, the number of new individual investors (customer) actively investing and trading has increased. This has also increased the number of expert individuals, who provide coaching services on trading such as technical indicators, techniques and trend discovery which helps a new investor to become a better trader.

## Goal 
Develop a platform that brings the customers (new individual investors) and expert service providers together.

## Solution
Leveraging the power of MuleSoftâ€™s connectivity, we are able to create a web-based platform that allows customers to onboard seamlessly with their current set up. An intuitive UI, that allows customers to choose coaching service providers based on their personal preferences and reviews. To avoid missing out on winning trades of the expert,  based on the user account size, trades can be replicated automatically.
